# 3D Models Directory

This directory is for storing 3D model files used in the hip prosthesis website.

## Required Models

- `hip_prosthesis.glb` - Main hip prosthesis model for the interactive viewer
- `acetabular_cup.glb` - Individual component model
- `femoral_head.glb` - Individual component model
- `liner.glb` - Individual component model
- `femoral_stem.glb` - Individual component model

## Model Sources

The models can be obtained by:
1. Converting the Sketchfab model to glTF/GLB format
2. Creating simplified versions of each component
3. Using medical imaging data to create accurate 3D models

## Conversion Process

To convert Sketchfab models to glTF/GLB format:
1. Download the model from Sketchfab (if permitted by the license)
2. Use Blender or another 3D modeling software to export as glTF/GLB
3. Optimize the model for web use (reduce polygon count, texture sizes, etc.)
4. Place the exported files in this directory

Note: Make sure to respect the original model's license and attribution requirements.
